# OpenDXL Webhooks Server

OpenDXL Webhooks Server is a lightweight Python server that may be used to integrate multiple platforms with [OpenDXL](https://www.opendxl.com/) (McAfee Open Data Exchange Layer) through Webhooks (HTTP POST requests). A well-known cybersecurity platform that uses Webhooks is Splunk (see screenshot bellow).

The server has been built using CherryPy.
